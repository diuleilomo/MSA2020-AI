# MSA2020-AI

This project is inspired by the classic titanic survival dataset, which is very popular among machine learning beginners. 

This project aims to develop a machine learning model and calculate the probability of survival rate of different groups of passengers.

Project outline:
1. Import the data 
2. Preprocessing the data using MinMaxScaler()
3. Split the data into training and testing sets
4. Fit the data into Decision Tree Classifier
5. Calculate the accuracy score of that model
6. Find the iterations with the maximum area under the curve
7. Show the AUC graphical visualization
8. Define the survival rate function
9. Calculate the survival rate of each group, identified by gender and class

To run this notebook:
1. Make sure to install:
    python, numpy, pandas, sklearn, matplotlib
2. Put the datafile ('titanic.csv) and run it under the same directory
